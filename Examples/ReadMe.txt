The examples shown in this directory each contain the necessary files to run an SDA procedure as an optimization,
extremizing a cost function via the variational method.The cost function has two terms: “measurement error” the divergence of the prediction from measurements, 
and “model error” the divergence of the prediction from model dynamics. Moreover, these examples contain the necessary files to run the forward integration procedure
given all the necessary parameters, as to compare the results of the interior point optimization to those of the forward integration.
These experiments are case studies of neutrino flavial evolution from Sun to Earth. More on these procedures can be found on : journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.103003.
